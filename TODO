# Modal

create a modal component that takes the url:
alecmolloy.com/portfolio?id=min-doktor

it should open with a spring animation from the existing card, to the middle of
the screen and close when clicking outside of it or the close button.

package someone made for (possibly) the same problem:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-reparenting

On mobile, it should fill the screen.

I think i might need to bump the modal up to the portfolio section. but maybe i
don't want to do that.
