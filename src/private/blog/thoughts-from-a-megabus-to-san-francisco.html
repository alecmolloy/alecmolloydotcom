<p>two years ago, when i did return, without telling anyone</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>like i was insecure about being able to relate my new “identity”</p>
						<p class='indent-2'>British-American</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>that they could see right through it.</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>ashamed: trying to shed my american accent, trying to have come from nowhere and everywhere</p>
						<p class='indent-2'>bea laughs at me and says i’m not british</p>
						<p class='indent-2'>gigi tells she doesn’t think of me as american</p>
						<p class='indent-2'>asså, hallååå</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>like a good londoner.</p>
      <p class='indent-1'>ashamed of facing pretention, having first left san jose for san francisco,</p>
            <p class='indent-2'>a warning shot</p>
<p>running from ticky-tacky apartments, paying off student loans in four years, buying a car, saving for a down payment</p>
<p>searching for something beyond Valley monoculture</p>
<p>so now four years, and i feel like i should apologise for leaving and not knowing how to talk about my new life?</p>
<p>maybe
      <p class='indent-1'>reconnect with friends i left behind.</p>
      <p class='indent-1'>take an “anthropological visit” to santana row, so karen and i can Other these funny, god-given place-identities</p>
      <p class='indent-1'>sit in dolores park with everyone and just pretend its all the same</p>
      <p class='indent-1'>humble myself.</p>
            <p class='indent-2'>pause to reflect</p>
                  <p class='indent-3'>on what i get from being on the move</p>
                  <p class='indent-3'>on what i get from Having Moved Countries Three Times since i last saw you (!)</p>
                        <p class='indent-4'>and we’re thinking of moving to berlin next summer (!) (!) (!)</p>
                  <p class='indent-3'>on a bowl of pho with stella before leaving. something something, what are you running from something ego something.</p>
                  <p class='indent-3'>it was a good conversation and i wish i could remember it better.</p>
