    <p>
      Utopia.app is a design and coding environment for React projects that runs
      entirely in the browser. It combines a code editor and design tool, with
      full two-way synchronization between design and code.

      I worked as a Creative Technologist, focusing on UI design and
      React/TypeScript development. Utopia was later acquired by Shopify and
      continues to be developed.
