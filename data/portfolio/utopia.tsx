      <p>
        Utopia.app is a design and coding environment for React projects that
        runs entirely in the browser. It combines a code editor and design tool,
        with full two-way synchronization between design and code.

        I worked as a Creative Technologist, designing the UI and writing the
        React/TypeScript/CSS interpreters they were coupled to. I set goalposts
        by designing the kinds of beautiful, physically-based interactions we
        wanted to make easy in the app, and built roadmaps to achieve them.
