      <p>
        I joined Adobe as a Digital Media Intern in the summer of 2012. I wrote,
        edited, designed, and managed learning content for Photoshop, Lightroom,
        InDesign, and Acrobat. I performed analytics for the editorial team,
        researched user experiences for data-driven design projects, and
        represented Adobe as a product expert in online communities. After the
        summer, my contract was extended to continue working full-time through
        my senior year at Santa Clara, just down the road from the headquarters.

        After graduation, I served as a Product Manager for Learning Games. I
        joined an intrapreneurship program and led a team responsible for
        building experimental learning games for Photoshop and Illustrator. I
        managed, researched, developed, QAâ€™d, and launched learning games that
        were given placement on the Creative Cloud app welcome splash screens,
        shown to 5+ million users, and contributed to a $10M ARR bump in trial
        conversions. By validating early MVPs with customers, I proved the
        profitability of games as a learning solution and secured funding for
        further development. I conducted in-person and remote research sessions
        with customers and articulated a product vision informed by user
        research and input from UX and Engineering teams.
