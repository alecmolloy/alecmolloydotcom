      I joined Adobe as a Digital Media Intern in the summer of 2012. I wrote,
      edited, designed, and managed learning content for Photoshop, Lightroom,
      InDesign, and Acrobat. I performed analytics for the editorial team,
      researched user experiences for data-driven design projects, and
      represented Adobe as a product expert in online communities. After the
      summer, my contract was extended to continue working full-time through my
      senior year at Santa Clara, just down the road from the headquarters.

      After graduation, I served as a Product Manager for Learning Games. I
      joined an intrapreneurship program and led a team responsible for building
      experimental learning games for Photoshop and Illustrator. I managed,
      researched, developed, QAâ€™d, and launched learning games that were given
      placement on the Creative Cloud app welcome splash screens, shown to 5+
      million users, and contributed to a $10M ARR bump in trial conversions. By
      validating early MVPs with customers, I proved the profitability of games
      as a learning solution and secured funding for further development. I
      conducted in-person and remote research sessions with customers and
      articulated a product vision informed by user research and input from UX
      and Engineering teams.
