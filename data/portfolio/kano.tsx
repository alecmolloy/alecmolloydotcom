      Kano creates technology kits and educational tools designed to help people
      of all ages learn to code, create, and understand technology. I joined as
      the first product manager to launch the record-breaking Kickstarter-backed
      Kano Computer Kit.

      I built user research into the company culture with regular visits to
      customer houses, schools, and coding spaces. I transformed a product with
      a great 2-hour unboxing experience, but poor longevity, into a
      retention-oriented creative content system that brought kids back daily.

      Eventually, I managed the web, creative tools, and Kano World community. I
      developed a remix-oriented learning content model that spurred significant
      platform growth. Later, I transitioned into a creative technologist role,
      working on new hardware products and digital creative tools like Make
      Light, LightBoard, Pixel Kit, Screen Kit, Camera Kit, and Speaker Kit.
