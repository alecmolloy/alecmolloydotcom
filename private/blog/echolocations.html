<p>I‚Äôve been thinking about how music creates moods,</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>how <a href='https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly'>spotify is the new musak</a></p>
			<p class='indent-1'>how, how cool i am, have been ‚Äúdesigning‚Äù my own musak-mood playlists, and </p>
			<p class='indent-1'>how brian eno‚Äôs ambient albums might shape the way I work, cook, or experience leisure, or might make me think i'm shaping something. anything.</p>
<p>how music remind us of places or periods,</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>how coldplay‚Äôs viva la vida puts me driving a ford escape at 90 miles per hour with the windows down on the merritt parkway, summer of 2008.</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>onuka puts me on the √∂resundsbron (&lt;3) or the Copenhagen Metro, on my way to and from two cities i tried, and failed, to call home</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>nils frahm puts me on my yoga mat in east london. all the teachers seem to like the victoria soundtrack to wind down with, especially the track from the bloody shootout in kreuzberg ü§î.</p>
<p>and why i wear headphones.</p>
			<p class='indent-1'><a href='https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/headphones-everywhere'>‚ÄúDo people really like music this much?‚Äù</a></p>
						<p class='indent-2'>a performance enhancer for staring down code editors and developer tools</p>
						<p class='indent-2'>why i‚Äôve started wearing noise-cancelling headphones</p>
									<p class='indent-3'>if i‚Äôm missing more than just the double-decker busses, running me down as i cross the street</p>
<p>i found andrew bird‚Äôs echolocations. its a series of albums, recorded barefoot, wading through water, violin reverberating through a utah canyon, the los angeles river. sound and space memories of</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>family roadtrips through the american southwest</p>
			<p class='indent-1'>biking to work along the guadalupe river</p>
<p>taking me into the field, asking me why i play music, where i listen to music, how space transforms music, how space should transform music.</p>
<p>barefoot, wading through water, violin playing off the sandstone, the poured concrete</p>
